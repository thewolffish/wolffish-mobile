/**

 *
 * The same surface the composer's expand button opens (chat/PromptEditorModal):
 * full screen, the app's own sans face, platform typo correction. The desktop
 * puts CodeMirror in these three fields, which is the right promise on a
 * keyboard — a gutter and monospace say "syntax goes here" — but on a phone
 * these are prose fields typed with thumbs, and this app already decided what
 * that surface is. What IS shared with the desktop is where the text is read
 * rather than written: the card previews render it as a monospaced code block,
 * exactly as the desktop's cards do (see PromptPreview).
 *
 * Done is the only exit — there is nothing to send here. The value comes back
 * on it and on the platform's back gesture, so a draft is never lost to a
 * swipe; callers autosave from that value on the debounce they already run.
