/**
 * The card both waits wear.
 *
 * Two of the three things asserted here are about a bug that produced NO
 * output at all, which is why they are pinned rather than eyeballed:
 *
 * - It is not a Modal. On iOS a Modal is a presented view controller and a
 *   second one cannot present while the first is up, so with any sheet open —
 *   the conversations list, an attachment picker, a settings dialog — the
 *   reconnect card silently failed to appear, on precisely the occasion the
 *   app most needed to speak. Rendered as an ordinary layer it always paints.
 * - It swallows what is underneath. That is the entire claim a blocking card
 *   makes, and as a plain View it is a claim that has to be built rather than
 *   inherited from the Modal it used to be.
 *
 * The third is the clock, which is the only honest number on the card: both
 * bars are phase-derived, so this is what separates a three-second blip from a
 * ninety-second outage.
