/**
 * Expanded prompt editor — the mobile take on the desktop's draft-expand modal:
 * the same draft the composer holds, with room to write it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a code editor, which is where this parts from the desktop
 * (CodeMirror in markdown mode, gutter and all). On a phone that is the wrong
 * promise: a monospaced field behind a line-number rail says "syntax goes
 * here", and what is being written is a message. So the app's own sans face,
 * the platform's typo correction, and a placeholder that names the one thing
 * this field is for — messaging Wolffish, or queueing for it mid-turn.
 *
 * It sends, too. The whole reason to open this is a prompt too long for the
 * composer's one row, and routing that prompt back through the composer to be
 * sent — Done, then aim for a 42.5pt button — is a step with nothing in it.
 * Send hands the draft over and the composer closes this in the same action.
 * Done stays for the other case: a draft that is not finished.
