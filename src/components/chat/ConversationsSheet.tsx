/**
 * The chat screen's navigator — the desktop's right-hand ConversationsSidebar,
 * turned into a sheet that comes in from the LEADING edge (left in LTR, right
 * in RTL, mirrored by direction rather than hard-coded).
 *
 * Two halves, in the desktop's own order:
 *
 *  - the five workspace pages that are not settings knobs but things you MAKE
 *    with the app (and Settings itself), each with the icon the desktop's nav
 *    rail gives it;
 *  - every conversation, grouped by the same recency buckets under the same
 *    labels, each row a numbered status chip + origin badge + one line of title.
 *
 * Only the second half scrolls. The pages are a fixed header ABOVE the list
 * rather than the list's own ListHeaderComponent: they are the sheet's five
 * destinations, and a destination that scrolls off the top of its own navigator
 * is one the user has to scroll back up to find. The list gets the space that
 * is left and scrolls inside it.
 *
 * The chip is the whole state readout, exactly as on the desktop: it counts the
 * conversation's rank in the WHOLE list (continuing across the date headers
 * rather than restarting under each), and it is tinted by what the last turn in
 * that conversation did — pale primary while one is running (pulsing) or while
 * the row is the open one, then success / error / stopped for as long as that
 * is fresh. See lib/conversations/rows.ts for where those phases come from.
 *
 * The list is windowed rather than paged: the index is already in memory (it is
 * one SQLite read), so "infinite scroll" here means rendering the first PAGE
 * rows and growing the window as the user reaches the end. The rank numbers are
 * computed after the slice, so they are the same numbers the full list would
 * have given — a window never renumbers anything.

 * The sheet's shell: whether it is on screen at all, and the slide.
 *
 * ON SCREEN IS A PURE FUNCTION OF `open`, and that is not a style choice — it
 * is the fix for the worst bug this component has had. The panel used to leave
 * on its own slide-out, which meant the Modal stayed mounted past `open` and
 * came down from an ANIMATION COMPLETION CALLBACK. Every run where that
 * callback did not arrive — the animation stopped by an effect re-run, the
 * native view detached because a screen was pushed over it (the sheet's own
 * Projects link does exactly that), a re-render heavy enough to interrupt it
 * (selecting a conversation remounts the whole feed) — left a full-screen,
 * fully transparent Modal presented over the app. It looked like nothing was
 * there and it swallowed every touch: the composer, the floating buttons, the
 * sheet's own trigger. "All the buttons froze" is precisely what that is.
 *
 * So the Modal is presented exactly while `open` is true, and the only leaving
 * animation is the one RN drives itself, natively, with no JS state to strand
 * (`animationType="fade"`). The slide is enter-only and nothing depends on its
 * callback.
 *
 * Everything that COSTS something — the conversation index, the project list,
 * the live turns, the rows built from all three — lives in the body below,
 * which only exists while the sheet does. A navigator that subscribes to the
 * whole conversation list from behind a closed door is a navigator that
 * re-renders the chat screen every time a turn writes a word.
