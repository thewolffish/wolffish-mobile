 * The project to work in, as a row of chips.
 *
 * Chips rather than a dropdown because the whole list is the point: the projects
 * are few, named and emoji'd, and one tap enters one — a Select hid every option
 * behind a modal to pick from a set that fits on the row itself. The row never
 * wraps; it scrolls freely on x however many projects there are, so adding the
 * twentieth costs the sheet no height.
 *
 * Choosing one ENTERS it: project mode is set, and the chat screen starts a fresh
 * conversation inside it (see the seenProjectRef rule in app/chat.tsx) — the same
 * thing tapping a card on the Projects screen does. It is deliberately not a
 * "re-file this conversation" control: a project's instructions are the base a
 * conversation starts FROM, so moving one already under way into a project would
 * show its chrome over turns that never received those instructions. The new
 * conversation is filed at creation, by the send itself.
 *
 * Chips come from the same project list the Projects screen and the project
 * dialog read and write, which is why they carry the project's own icon and
 * title rather than the id conversations bind by; a conversation pointing at a
 * project that list no longer has keeps showing its raw id rather than silently
 * reading as unfiled.
