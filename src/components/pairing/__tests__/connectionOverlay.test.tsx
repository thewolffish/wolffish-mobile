/**
 * One interruption per episode.
 *
 * The reconnect card and the sync card used to be separate overlays, so a
 * single drop mid-use interrupted twice: the first vanished the instant the
 * link formed and the second blinked in over the same spot a beat later.
 * What is pinned here is the merged contract:
 *
 * - a blip that resolves quickly still shows nothing at all (the thresholds
 *   both originals had are kept, each trigger judged against its own clock);
 * - an episode that does surface walks reconnect → sync on ONE card, with the
 *   handoff gap between "connected" and the reconcile's first report bridged
 *   rather than hidden through;
 * - one dismissal covers the whole episode, catch-up included — whoever chose
 *   "continue offline" must not be interrupted again by the sync that follows
 *   the reconnect they were not waiting on.
