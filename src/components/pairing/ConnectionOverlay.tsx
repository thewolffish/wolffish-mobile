/**
 * The one card for everything the desktop link goes through: reconnecting,
 * then the catch-up that every reconnect runs, then gone.
 *
 * These used to be two overlays — one watching the tunnel, one watching the
 * sync — and a single blip mid-use interrupted twice: a reconnect card that
 * vanished the instant the link formed, then a sync card blinking in over the
 * same spot a beat later. They were always one event to the user (the app is
 * busy with the desktop), so they are one card now: it appears once, walks
 * through whichever phases the episode actually has, and leaves once,
 * wearing the same BlockingProgress face throughout.
 *
 * What did NOT change is when anything underneath runs. The tunnel's
 * reconnects, the reconcile on every connection, the activity reporting —
 * all untouched; this merges presentation only.
 *
 * The thresholds are the design, kept from both originals so the ordinary
 * case stays exactly as silent as it was:
 *
 * - An outage must last APPEAR_RECONNECT_MS before anything appears —
 *   reconnecting after a blip is routine and usually lands in well under a
 *   second, and a modal in front of that makes a working app feel broken.
 * - A catch-up must run APPEAR_SYNC_MS before it appears — an unchanged
 *   desktop answers in milliseconds and deserves no dialog at all.
 * - A card already up never blinks between phases: connect-then-sync swaps
 *   the words on the same card, and the end holds through MIN_VISIBLE_MS so
 *   a sync that finished just past its threshold reads as progress, not a
 *   glitch.
