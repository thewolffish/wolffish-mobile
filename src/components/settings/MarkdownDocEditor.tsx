/**
 * The expanded editor for one customization document — the chat composer's
 * PromptEditorModal, pointed at a file instead of a draft: same full-screen
 * modal, same header-with-two-buttons, same keyboard handling.
 *
 * What differs is what is being written. This is markdown the agent reads as
 * instructions, so it wears the code-block face the card preview wears — mono,
 * 12/18 — and it turns OFF the conveniences a message field wants: autocorrect
 * would quietly rewrite `brain/prefrontal/agents.md`, and autocapitalize would
 * fight every `- ` bullet and every `#` heading. Spellcheck stays, matching the
 * desktop's CodeMirror, because the prose inside these documents is still prose.
 *
 * State is mounted-fresh per open (the parent keys this by document), so a
 * document that changes on the desktop while this is open never overwrites what
 * is being typed here — the same dirty rule the desktop editor follows.
 *
 * Mount it only while editing: an unmounted modal cannot hold a stale draft,
 * and RN keeps no state for it either way.
