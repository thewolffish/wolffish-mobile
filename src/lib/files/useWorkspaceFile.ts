 *
 * "Instantly" is load-bearing, not a nicety: a file already on disk resolves
 * during render, so its card mounts at full size in the same frame as the rest
 * of the message. Going through the effect instead would mount a placeholder
 * first and grow a frame later, which shifts every message below it and pulls
 * the feed's scroll position with it — the jump this hook exists to avoid.
