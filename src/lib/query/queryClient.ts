 * Server-state layer. The query cache is persisted to the device so remote
 * content survives restarts and refreshes slowly in the background instead of
 * refetching everything up front:
 *
 * - gcTime keeps data eligible for persistence for 7 days.
 * - staleTime means cached data renders instantly and refetches in the
 *   background only after a minute of staleness.
 * - maxAge on the persister drops anything older than 7 days at restore.
 *
 * Conversation queries are backed by SQLite (lib/conversations) and are
 * excluded from AsyncStorage persistence — SQLite is already durable, and
 * mirroring hundreds of conversations into AsyncStorage would defeat the
 * point of the database.
