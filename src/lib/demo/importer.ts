 * step there is.
 *
 * The 18 MB of conversation JSON arrives as ~1.5 MB shards (see the bundle
 * script for why), each downloaded, parsed, imported into SQLite and released
 * before the next one starts. Cloudflare brotli/gzips application/json in
 * transit, so the wire cost is ~4 MB and the client needs no decompression.
 *
 * The media those conversations reference is a separate, lazier layer: each
 * workspace path resolves to the published sample for its file type and is
 * fetched on first view (see lib/files/sampleFiles.ts) — the same
 * metadata-first, content-on-demand flow the real desktop sync will use.
