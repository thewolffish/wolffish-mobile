/**
 * Wipe every trace of an imported demo dataset.
 *
 * A republished bundle is a NEW dataset, not a patch: conversations are
 * dropped upstream as well as added, media behind a workspace path can change
 * bytes without changing its path, and the config snapshot can lose a
 * capability or a project. Importing over the top only ever upserts, so
 * without this every device that has already entered demo mode accumulates the
 * union of every bundle it has seen — deleted conversations linger, stale
 * media renders, and the phone disagrees with the CDN in ways nothing on
 * screen explains. Purging first is what makes "new version" mean the same
 * thing on a returning device as on a fresh install.
 *
 * Everything demo mode writes, in the order a half-finished purge is safest:
 *
 *   1. `demoVersion` — cleared FIRST. If anything below throws or the app is
 *      killed mid-wipe, the device reads as "nothing imported" and the next
 *      tap redownloads, rather than claiming a dataset it no longer holds.
 *   2. SQLite — conversations, messages, and the cached_files LRU index.
 *   3. Documents/workspace — the media those conversations referenced.
 *   4. Documents/demo — the saved config snapshot.
 *   5. cache/downloads — scratch space from interrupted media downloads.
 *   6. The demo config store — back to its defaults, so a value the new
 *      snapshot does not carry cannot survive from the old one.
 *   7. The live chat runtime — in-flight streams point at conversation ids
 *      that no longer exist.
 *   8. The persisted query cache — anything derived from the above.
 *
 * Every step is independently guarded: a directory that cannot be deleted must
 * not cost the database wipe, and vice versa. Safe to run when there is
 * nothing to purge, which is why the import path runs it unconditionally
 * rather than trying to decide whether this device needs it.
