 *
 * An automation is a markdown heading (the schedule) plus the prompt underneath
 * it; switching one off comments the block out. There is no per-automation
 * record anywhere — the file IS the store, and the desktop's scheduler parses
 * it — so every edit here is "read the whole file, splice one block, write the
 * whole file back", exactly as the desktop's card editor does.
 *
 * This module is a direct port of that page's parser and splicer (wolffish-app
 * src/renderer/src/pages/Heartbeat.tsx), deliberately pure and with no imports:
 * it is the one piece of the feature that manipulates the workspace's own file
 * format, and a divergence between the two implementations would corrupt the
 * file for both screens. Keep the rules below in step with that page and with
 * the engine's own splitMarkers (main/runtime/brainstem.ts).
