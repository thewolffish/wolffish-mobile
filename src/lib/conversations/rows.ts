/**
 * ONE definition of "which conversations to list, and what state each is in" —
 * the desktop's buildConversationRows (src/renderer/src/lib/conversation-rows.ts)
 * ported to the phone's two sources of truth.
 *
 * The desktop merges its indexed list with a live `runStatuses` map fed by the
 * cross-channel chat:turnState broadcast. The phone has the same broadcast
 * (Event.turnStatus) but it does not need a map to know what is RUNNING: a turn
 * in flight — started here, on the desktop, or on a channel — already has a live
 * entry in chatRuntime, because that is what draws the streaming reply. So:
 *
 *   processing        a live stream with status 'streaming' exists
 *   completed/failed/
 *   stopped           the last terminal transition, while it is still FRESH
 *   null              anything older, and anything that never ran this session
 *
 * Deriving `processing` from the live stream rather than from a stored flag is
 * what makes it self-correcting: a phone that drops mid-turn and reconnects
 * re-settles its streams (see attachTurnStream), so a run that ended while it
 * was away cannot leave a chip pulsing forever — the desktop's terminal push
 * for it was lost, and no amount of remembering 'started' would recover it.
