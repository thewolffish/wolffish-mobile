 * Recency buckets for conversation lists — the desktop's

 * both apps slice history at the SAME boundaries under the SAME labels.
 *
 * The windows coarsen as they recede — a day, a day, a week, a month, a
 * quarter, a half-year, a year, then everything before that. That widening is
 * the point: recent work is scanned by exact day, old work by rough era, so a
 * long list stays retrievable without ever growing a scroll of undifferentiated
 * rows.
 *
 * Generic over the row type, because the phone lists conversations from two
 * shapes and both must bucket identically: the History screen groups raw index
 * rows by `updatedAt`, and the conversations sheet groups merged rows by `at`
 * (which a running turn lifts). One ladder, one set of labels, one numbering
 * rule — a second copy is how two surfaces end up disagreeing about what
 * "Yesterday" means.
