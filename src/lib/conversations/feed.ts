/**
 * The chat feed's row list: the stored transcript with the in-flight turn laid
 * over it.
 *
 * The whole point of this function is that it is a PURE MERGE with no notion of
 * time. Every earlier attempt at "show the live turn, then swap in the saved
 * copy" was a sequencing problem — clear the overlay too early and the row is
 * in neither place (a blank); too late and it is in both (a duplicate). Neither
 * ordering can be guaranteed, because the two halves arrive independently: the
 * desktop pushes turn.status the moment a turn ends but persists the message
 * before that, and the body fetch that follows may or may not have caught it.
 *
 * So nothing is sequenced. Both halves are addressed by MESSAGE ID — the phone
 * mints the prompt's id and sends it with the turn, the desktop stamps its
 * assistant message once and mirrors it under that id — and while the overlay
 * is mounted, ITS copy of that message is the one emitted (the stored copy can
 * be a mid-run progress snapshot, saved so an automation survives a quit, and
 * is then strictly older than the mirror). The overlay can therefore be
 * dropped whenever, arrive whenever, and repeat: the feed is the same either
 * way, because it is only ever dropped once the stored transcript holds the
 * final copy of the same message.
 *
 * The assistant row's key is fixed rather than derived from the message. A
 * turn's live row starts as a thinking indicator with no id at all and later
 * learns the desktop's; keying on that would remount the row mid-turn and
 * restart the typed words. There is at most one live assistant row, so one
 * constant key is enough to keep it mounted for the whole turn.
