/**
 * The Debug button's export, from the phone's side.
 *
 * The collecting is the desktop's and is tested there. What only exists here is
 * the ORCHESTRATION, and every case below is an outcome that has to reach the
 * overlay as a renderable result rather than as a thrown error — an overlay
 * that cannot be dismissed until the run settles must always get something to
 * settle on.
 *
 * The load-bearing one is the last: a failed TRANSFER is not a failed export.
 * The archive exists on the desktop either way, and telling the user their
 * bundle failed when it is sitting in their workspace sends them round the
 * whole loop again for nothing.
