/**
 * Sending a turn from the phone, and rendering the one the desktop runs.
 *
 * The desktop runs every turn — it holds the models, the capabilities and the
 * workspace. The phone hands over the prompt and renders what comes back, which
 * arrives as events rather than a reply: `message.appended` carrying the
 * assistant message as it grows, `message.delta` for the text between those
 * snapshots, and `turn.status` around the edges. That is the same stream the
 * desktop's own chat view consumes, which is why a turn started here looks
 * identical on both screens.
 *
 * A turn started on the OTHER side arrives the same way, with one addition:
 * `message.appended` also carries the prompt being answered. It has to. The
 * desktop's chat view has that prompt in its own feed and writes it to disk
 * only when the turn folds, so a phone with the conversation open — or one
 * that pairs halfway through, which is how this was found — has it neither
 * stored nor streamed, and renders an answer to a question that is nowhere
 * on screen. Every snapshot repeats it, because a late joiner only ever sees
 * snapshots.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE WHOLE CONTRACT. The phone must show the same things in the same
 * sequence the desktop does — later is fine, out of order or flickering is not
 * — and everything below follows from that:
 *
 *  - The turn appears at the TAP, not at the reply. A round trip to the desktop
 *    (which mints the conversation for a new chat) is dead air otherwise, and
 *    dead air is where the user presses Send again.
 *  - Nothing that arrives mid-turn writes to SQLite, and nothing mid-turn
 *    refetches the body. The desktop persists an assistant message once, when
 *    the turn ends; a fetch before that returns a transcript WITHOUT it and
 *    overwrites what the phone is showing — the vanishing reply.
 *  - Live rows carry the ids the desktop will save them under, so the feed
 *    drops each one exactly when the stored copy takes its place. See
 *    conversations/feed.ts — that merge is what makes every ordering safe.
 *
 * Live state lives in chatRuntime, keyed by conversation, so it survives
 * leaving and re-entering a conversation mid-turn and is readable from tests
 * without a renderer.
