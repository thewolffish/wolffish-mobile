 * ready / installing / error), now also driven from this phone. A check or
 * install sent from here lands on the SAME registered handlers a click on
 * the desktop or a CLI command invokes, so the acts cannot drift.
 *
 * IN MEMORY ONLY, and cleared the moment the tunnel drops, for the overlay
 * rule: every phase claims something is happening right now on a machine
 * this one cannot see. During an install that is literally true — the
 * desktop is down restarting — and the reconnect plus the fresh snapshot it
 * brings are what report the outcome: a new version on the Updates screen.
 *
 * State arrives as `updater.state` pushes, so a phone connecting mid-download
 * has missed every announcement; `seedDesktopUpdater()` closes that window
 * once per connection, exactly like the overlay seed.
 *
 * `state: null` means nothing is known — not connected, or a desktop too old
 * (or unable) to serve the updater RPCs. The Updates screen hides its
 * controls then, which is precisely the pre-feature screen.
