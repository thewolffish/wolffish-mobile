/**
 * Automations — the desktop's `brain/brainstem/heartbeat.md`.
 *
 * The file is the store, so this module carries no per-automation write: it
 * reads the whole file (plus the scheduler's live view of it) and writes the
 * whole file back. All the block surgery in between is
 * lib/automations/heartbeat.ts, which is pure and tested; this file is only the
 * wire and the cache.
 *
 * Writes are SERIALIZED through one chain, deliberately. Every edit is a
 * read-modify-write of one file, and two of them in flight against the same
 * snapshot would silently drop the earlier one — the desktop's own page
 * serializes its card saves for exactly this reason. The chain also re-reads the
 * newest markdown before each splice, so an edit made on the desktop between
 * two of this screen's saves is not clobbered.
