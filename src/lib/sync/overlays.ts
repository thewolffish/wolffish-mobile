/**
 * Overlays — what the desktop is busy doing right now, as cards over whatever
 * screen the phone is on.
 *
 * The desktop draws four of these and treats them as two unrelated systems.
 * Three (automations, compaction, reflection) are the brainstem's run pool, all
 * rendered by one floating card; the fourth (reindexing) is a blocking overlay
 * that replaces its chat screen for the duration. The phone shows all four the
 * same way, because a phone that cannot be used at all while an index rebuilds
 * is a phone that looks broken, and because four kinds of "the desktop is
 * working" should not be four kinds of interruption.
 *
 * IN MEMORY ONLY, and cleared the moment the tunnel drops. Every card claims
 * something is happening *right now* on a machine this one cannot see; a card
 * that survived a relaunch, or an hour offline, would be asserting that on no
 * evidence. There is nothing to restore it from either — the desktop announces
 * transitions, not history — which is what `seedOverlays` is for.
 *
 * Both halves arrive as pushes and neither has a screen that fetches it, so a
 * phone connecting mid-run has already missed the only announcement it was
 * going to get. `seedOverlays()` closes that window once per connection; the
 * pushes keep it current after that.
 *
 * Unpaired (demo) phones have no overlays and never will: there is no desktop
 * running anything. The stack renders nothing, which is the truth.
