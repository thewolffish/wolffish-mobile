/**
 * Where the notification LOG gets written, and the one unit conversion that
 * quietly decides whether every card on iOS is dated 1970.
 *
 * `Notification.date` is not the same quantity on the two platforms:
 * expo-notifications serializes Android's `Date.getTime()` (milliseconds) and
 * iOS's `timeIntervalSince1970` (SECONDS). Taken at face value, every iOS
 * notification the app picked up from the tray would render as "56 years ago"
 * — a whole feature that looks broken because of a factor of a thousand. The
 * fix is magnitude-based rather than platform-based, so it survives either
 * platform changing its mind, and this is what holds it.
 *
 * The third is WHICH CONVERSATION a notification belongs to, which is not the
 * same question as where its tap goes. notify_phone lets the model omit the
 * deeplink entirely, so reading the badge off the link meant those arrived
 * belonging to nothing: a conversation that had raised five notifications wore
 * a 2 while the page showed all five. The desktop stamps the run's own
 * conversation on every frame now, and the deeplink only outranks it when it
 * deliberately names a different one.
 *
 * The other half is provenance: WHEN a notification was sent is the desktop's
 * answer, not the handset's. A phone that was off for three hours receives a
 * push three hours late, and a card dated by arrival would be three hours
 * wrong. So the desktop's `ts` rides both paths — our own in-band render
 * copies it into the local notification's data, the relay stamps it onto the
 * push payload — and it wins over the delivery date wherever it is present.
