/**
 * Model-initiated notifications, phone side.
 *
 * Two delivery paths land here and the user must never see the same
 * notification twice:
 *
 * - IN-BAND: the relay sends a `notification` control frame over the live
 *   tunnel; we render it locally and answer `notification_ack`. If our ack
 *   is not back at the relay within ~2 s it ALSO sends the Expo push, so…
 * - PUSH: …a remote push can arrive for a notification already rendered.
 *   The persisted `seen` LRU below is what folds the two into one: in-band
 *   renders mark the id seen, and the foreground handler refuses to show a
 *   remote push whose id it already knows. (A push arriving while the app
 *   is closed is displayed by the OS before we run — unavoidable, and only
 *   reachable when the tunnel died mid-ack, since a *live* tunnel is what
 *   makes the relay try in-band first.)
 *
 * Nothing here sends notifications. The phone registers where it can be
 * reached and renders what arrives; whether anything is sent at all is the
 * desktop model's deliberate tool call, rate-limited over there.
 *
 * WHERE A TAP GOES is the third thing this file owns, and it has two arrivals
 * that look alike and are not: a tap on a running app (the response listener,
 * which navigates on the spot) and the tap that STARTED the app, which has to
 * be read before the entry screen redirects or it ends up racing it. See
 * launchDeeplink.
