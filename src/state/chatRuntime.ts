 * makes the feed monotone. A mid-turn write to SQLite means the body fetch
 * that follows can DELETE it again (the desktop persists an assistant message
 * once, at the end of the turn), and every one of those windows was a row
 * appearing and then vanishing on screen.
 *
 * One entry covers a whole turn, from both ends of it:
 *
 *   user       the prompt this phone just sent, shown from the instant Send is
 *              pressed — before the RPC has even returned a conversation id.
 *   message    the assistant message being written. Empty ⇒ the feed shows the
 *              typed thinking words, exactly as demo mode does.
 *   base/tail  see prompt.ts: `base` is the last full snapshot the desktop
 *              pushed, `tail` the text deltas received since. `message` is the
 *              two composed, and is the only field the feed reads.
 *
 * Both messages carry the ids the desktop will persist them under, so the feed
 * can drop each one the moment the stored transcript contains it — no
 * sequencing, no window where a row is in neither place or in both.

   * the common one — flashed a "rate this turn" over a turn still being
