/**
 * The notification log — every model-initiated notification this phone has
 * rendered, kept so the user can read them again on their own screen instead
 * of only in the split second the OS banner is up.
 *
 * WHY THE PHONE HAS TO KEEP THIS ITSELF. Nothing upstream holds a history to
 * fetch: the desktop mints a notification and fires it, the relay routes it
 * and remembers only an idempotency marker, and the OS tray forgets whatever
 * the user swipes away. So the log is written at ARRIVAL, by every path in
 * lib/notifications/push.ts that renders one — the in-band frame, the
 * foreground push, the tray reconciliation that catches what landed while the
 * app was dead, and the tap that opens the app. Records are keyed by
 * notificationId and the first write wins, which is what lets all four paths
 * see the same notification without it appearing four times.
 *
 * The one thing it CANNOT recover is a push that arrived while the app was
 * dead and was dismissed from the tray before the app next opened: nothing of
 * ours ran, and nothing anywhere else kept it.
 *
 * THIS LOG IS ALSO THE BADGES. Every unread count in the app is derived from
 * the records below — the number on a conversation row, the total on the app
 * icon, the count the relay stamps onto pushes, and the one on the sheet's
 * Notifications row. It did not used to be: a separate store kept a counter
 * per conversation, incremented at arrival and decremented on read, and two
 * counters for one fact drift the moment any arrival path treats them
 * differently. A notification that reached the log without incrementing the
 * counter — one that arrived while its own conversation was on screen — left
 * the page saying two unread and the conversation row saying one. Derived,
 * that disagreement cannot be expressed.
 *
 * THREE FLAGS, and they are not the same question:
 *
 *  - `read` is about attention. It starts false except on a tap (the tap IS
 *    the answer) and on a notification that arrives for the conversation the
 *    user is already looking at — which is the same answer, a beat earlier.
 *  - `archived` is about the inbox. One-way, and archiving reads at the same
 *    time, so an archived notification is always read and the archive tab is
 *    a finished pile rather than a second inbox.
 *  - `counted` is about the OS ICON, and only that. It is a STANDING property
 *    rather than a record of something that happened: may this notification
 *    put a number on the app's springboard icon (and on the relay's copy of
 *    that number, which stamps pushes while the app is away)? True for every
 *    real arrival. False only for the demo's seeded log — a demo has no relay
 *    and no push, so a number it put on the home-screen icon would outlive the
 *    tour. Everything INSIDE the app still counts it: the demo's conversation
 *    rows and its Notifications row read the same records the real ones do,
 *    because a count that disagrees with the list beside it is the bug this
 *    whole store exists to make impossible.
