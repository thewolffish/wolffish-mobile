/**
 * Unread notification badges, the phone's authoritative copy.
 *
 * One bucket per conversation: how many model-initiated notifications have
 * arrived for it that the user has not yet answered by OPENING it. General
 * notifications — ones that deep-link to a settings page or nowhere — are
 * deliberately never counted here: opening the app is what clears those, and
 * an open app is the only place this store is ever rendered. They still reach
 * the OS icon while the app is away, because the relay counts every delivered
 * notification into the push `badge`; the moment the app opens, the sync in
 * lib/notifications/push.ts overwrites icon and relay with this store's
 * conversation-only total, which is exactly the "cleared on open" the general
 * ones want.
 *
 * The store never decides what counts — push.ts does (it knows the deeplink,
 * the active conversation, the app state). The store owns the two invariants
 * that make badges trustworthy: every notification id counts AT MOST ONCE
 * (`counted`, an LRU shared by both delivery paths, so an in-band render and
 * its Expo fallback can never double-count), and a bucket cannot outlive its
 * conversation (`clearConversation` on open/delete, `prune` after a full
 * index sync for conversations deleted while the phone was away).
