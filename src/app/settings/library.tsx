/**
 * Library — Automations, Projects and Procedures as one screen with three
 * tabs, the desktop's Library page.
 *
 * The same move Customization made for Soul, User and Agents: three sheet
 * rows that each opened a near-identical card list under its own back button
 * become one destination. The tabs sit in a strip pinned under the header
 * (the desktop puts them beside its back button; a phone header has no room
 * for three labelled tabs at a tappable size), and the three tabs keep their
 * own state, loads and editor sheets — this screen only owns the chrome they
 * used to duplicate.
 *
 * Only the active tab is mounted, and the screen is keyed by it: there is no
 * draft to keep warm across tabs — each is a list over a file the desktop
 * pushes changes for, so remounting is a cheap reload — and a fresh scroller
 * per tab is what keeps Projects from opening halfway down where Automations
 * was left.
 *
 * The cards/markdown toggle Automations used to keep beside its own heading
 * sits at the trailing end of the header while that tab is active, exactly
 * where the desktop's Library puts it; `view` lives here because the header
 * does.
 *
 * The old routes (settings/projects, settings/automations, settings/procedures)
 * still exist as redirects into this one with the tab preselected: they are on
 * the two-repo deep-link allowlist, and a notification the desktop sends
 * naming one of them must keep landing on the right list.
