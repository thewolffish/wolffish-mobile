/**
 * The chat screen — the desktop Chat page adapted to one column, and the only
 * screen the app really has: a bottom-pinned feed under two floating controls
 * (the conversations sheet, a new chat), and a composer with send/stop/record.
 * Works identically for a fresh chat and for any conversation the sheet opens.
 *
 * There is no top bar. The sheet is the navigator — every core page and every
 * conversation — and it opens a conversation IN PLACE rather than pushing a
 * copy of this screen per row tapped. That is the desktop's model (one window,
 * many conversations, turns running concurrently in whichever) and it is what
 * `opened` and `generationRef` below exist to make safe.
 *
 * The feed is a plain ScrollView, deliberately:
 * - inverted FlatList: Fabric text measurement explodes on RTL-heavy rows
 *   (real Arabic conversations blanked the whole feed);
 * - non-inverted FlatList: scrollToEnd targets the ESTIMATED content end,
 *   which never converges with a few huge rows, so opening at the bottom
 *   is unreliable.
 * Conversations are small (median 2, max 30 messages in three months of
 * real data), so full rendering is cheap and bottom-pinning deterministic.
 * Everything about WHERE that ScrollView sits lives in ChatFeed.
 *
 * The screen has four display states and exactly one transition between any
 * two of them, because the alternative — letting each state appear as soon as
 * its data happens to arrive — is what made opening a conversation flash the
 * hero, then the top of the transcript, then snap to the end:
 *
 *   new chat        no id, nothing to load          → hero, immediately
 *   opening         id, transcript not laid out yet → skeleton
 *   open            transcript pinned to its end    → feed, faded in
 *   empty           id, but genuinely no messages   → hero
 *
 * The skeleton covers the whole "opening" window — reading SQLite, downloading
 * the body over the tunnel, laying the messages out, pinning to the end — so
 * the transcript is never seen anywhere but at its final position.
 *
 * SENDING adds a fifth state that none of those four can express, and getting
 * it wrong is what made a prompt sent from here disappear into nothing: a new
 * chat has no conversation to load, so it is neither "opening" (no skeleton)
 * nor "empty" (the hero is gone the moment the user sends) for the whole round
 * trip in which the desktop mints one. The prompt is therefore rendered from
 * local state for exactly that window — `pendingUser` — and handed to the live
 * turn the moment there is an id to file it under. Neither the hero nor a bare
 * feed is ever shown while a turn is in flight.
 *
 * SENDING MID-TURN goes INTO the running turn, not behind it: a submit that
 * arrives while a turn is running is handed to the desktop's turn runner
 * (Rpc.interject) and the agent reads it at its next step — "skip the tests
 * folder", "use the other file" — instead of after the work it was meant to
 * steer is finished. It enters the feed at once, as the user's own bubble
 * after the live assistant row with a "read at the next step" caption, and
 * moves inside the assistant card when the agent reads it. See
 * `interjectSubmit` below, and sync/prompt.ts interject.
