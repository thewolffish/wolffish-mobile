/**
 * The chat screen, rendered, across the moment a prompt is sent.
 *
 * conversations/feed.ts decides what rows exist and turnOrdering.test.ts drives
 * the wire; neither of them can catch the screen putting those rows on hold.
 * That was the first half of the complaint — "I see nothing when I send a
 * prompt" — and it lived entirely here: a new chat has no conversation to load,
 * so it fell through the hero (gone the moment feed length changed) into a
 * conversation query that had not resolved, and rendered an empty feed for the
 * length of a round trip.
 *
 * So this asserts frames, like the others, but real ones — what is mounted
 * after each step, including the two handovers where a blank could hide: the
 * tap, and the arrival of the conversation id.
