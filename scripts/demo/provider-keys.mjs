/**
 * Synthetic API keys for the demo dataset.
 *
 * Every key in demo/config-snapshot.json came from demoApiKey(id): fake,
 * shaped like that provider's public key format. The only input is the
 * provider id — a public string — so no real secret is ever an ingredient, and
 * re-minting produces byte-identical keys instead of churning the snapshot.
 * When hand-adding a provider to the snapshot, mint its key with:
 *
 *   node scripts/demo/provider-keys.mjs <provider-id>
 *
 * Formats are modelled on each vendor's documented prefix/length. They are
 * cosmetic: nothing validates them, they authenticate nothing, and the demo
 * never sends them anywhere.
