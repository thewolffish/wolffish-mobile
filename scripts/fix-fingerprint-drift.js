// Undoes a node_modules edit that silently forks the runtime fingerprint.
//
// @react-native-masked-view/masked-view rewrites its OWN AndroidManifest.xml
// from android/build.gradle, at Gradle *configuration* time: on AGP >= 7 it
// strips `package="org.reactnative.maskedview"` in favour of a namespace and
// writes the file back into node_modules. So any local Android build — npm run
// android, or anything that configures Gradle — permanently edits an installed
// dependency. (The library means to tidy the leftover double space afterwards,
// but discards the result: `manifestContent.replaceAll("  ", " ")` on an
// immutable string. The stripped file is what stays on disk.)
//
// That file is a fingerprint input: @expo/fingerprint hashes the package
// directory whole as an autolinked native source, for BOTH platforms
// (rncoreAutolinkingAndroid and rncoreAutolinkingIos — iOS is affected too,
// even though only Gradle causes it). EAS installs dependencies fresh and
// fingerprints before Gradle ever runs, so it always sees the pristine file.
// The two sides then disagree and every deploy path breaks:
//   - eas build fails outright: "Runtime version calculated on local machine
//     not equal to runtime version calculated during build"
//   - DEPLOY.md's gate A reports a false mismatch, and the procedure says to
//     obey it without argument — routing a JS-only change to a needless store
//     release, every time, for as long as the edit sits there
//
// Putting the attribute back is the whole fix. It is inert on AGP >= 7 (Gradle
// re-strips it on the next build; this script puts it back before the next
// fingerprint), and it makes the local hash identical to the one EAS computes.
// Idempotent: a no-op when the manifest is already pristine, and silent when
// the package isn't installed.
